# DrinkGame

This is my first own bigger programming project. I was already familiar with Java and wanted to
learn about mobile app development. I created a simple "card" game with custom questions and rules.

Before I shifted my focus to full-stack development, I managed to get the game up and running. There
are still some pending features, such as Google play login integration, which is not finished. The
last time I worked on this project was at the beginning of the year 2023. Perhaps, in the future,
I will prepare the project for the Google Play Store!
